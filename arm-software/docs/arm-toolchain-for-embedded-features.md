In addition to the LLVM tools, Arm Toolchain for Embedded provides a
utility `elf2bin`. This extracts the contents of the loadable segments
from an ELF executable file, and outputs it in various forms suitable
for loading into embedded targets, such as Intel Hex, Motorola
S-records, or raw binary files. The documentation for `elf2bin` can be
found in `elf2bin.md`.
