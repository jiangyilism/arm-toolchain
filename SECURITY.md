# Reporting Arm Toolchain Security Issues
 
To report security issues in LLVM components of Arm Toolchain,
please follow LLVM Project
[security policy](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
 
To report security issues in any other components of Arm Toolchain,
please use the _Report a vulnerability_ feature under the Security tab.
 
> Please refer to
> [What is considered a security issue?](https://llvm.org/docs/Security.html#what-is-considered-a-security-issue)
> in LLVM Project for an overview of which toolchain components are considered
> security-sensitive.
>
> The `picolibc` and `newlib` standard C libraries are not part of the `llvm-project`,
> however Arm Toolchain treats these in the same way as the `llvm-project` runtime libraries.
