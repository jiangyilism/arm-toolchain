# Arm Toolchain

> [!WARNING]
> This project is under construction.

Welcome to the Arm Toolchain project!

This repository contains the source code for the Arm Toolchain
project, a fork of the LLVM project containing build scripts and
auxiliary material for building LLVM based toolchains targeting
Arm for bare-metal or native AArch64 Linux environments.

## Goal

This project aims to provide an LLVM based platform containing
the necessary libraries and tools for building C and C++ toolchains
for:
* Bare-metal: [Arm Toolchain for Embedded](https://github.com/arm/arm-toolchain/blob/arm-software/arm-software/embedded/README.md)
* Native AArch64 Linux: [Arm Toolchain for Linux](https://github.com/arm/arm-toolchain/blob/arm-software/arm-software/linux/README.md)
